In the course of his teaching Jesus said,<br />"Beware of the scribes, who like to go around in long robes<br />and accept greetings in the marketplaces,<br />seats of honor in synagogues,<br />and places of honor at banquets.<br />They devour the houses of widows and, as a pretext,<br />recite lengthy prayers.<br />They will receive a very severe condemnation."<br /><br />He sat down opposite the treasury<br />and observed how the crowd put money into the treasury.<br />Many rich people put in large sums.<br />A poor widow also came and put in two small coins worth a few cents. <br />Calling his disciples to himself, he said to them,<br />"Amen, I say to you, this poor widow put in more<br />than all the other contributors to the treasury.<br />For they have all contributed from their surplus wealth,<br />but she, from her poverty, has contributed all she had,<br />her whole livelihood."
