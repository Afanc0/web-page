As Jesus was teaching in the temple area he said,<br />"How do the scribes claim that the Christ is the son of David?<br />David himself, inspired by the Holy Spirit, said:<br /><br /><em>The Lord said to my lord,<br />'Sit at my right hand<br />until I place your enemies under your feet.'</em><br /><br />David himself calls him 'lord';<br />so how is he his son?"<br />The great crowd heard this with delight.<br /><br />
