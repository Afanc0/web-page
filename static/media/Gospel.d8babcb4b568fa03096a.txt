Jesus said to the Jewish crowds:<br />"I am the living bread that came down from heaven;<br />whoever eats this bread will live forever;<br />and the bread that I will give<br />is my flesh for the life of the world."<br /><br />The Jews quarreled among themselves, saying,<br />"How can this man give us his flesh to eat?" <br />Jesus said to them,<br />"Amen, amen, I say to you,<br />unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood,<br />you do not have life within you. <br />Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood<br />has eternal life,<br />and I will raise him on the last day. <br />For my flesh is true food,<br />and my blood is true drink. <br />Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood<br />remains in me and I in him. <br />Just as the living Father sent me<br />and I have life because of the Father,<br />so also the one who feeds on me<br />will have life because of me. <br />This is the bread that came down from heaven. <br />Unlike your ancestors who ate and still died,<br />whoever eats this bread will live forever."<br /><br />
